# Perform one question at a time. Each question is commented out and clearly separated. Only uncomment one
# question at a time. A quick way to do this is to highlight each line the
# question then press ctrl + /
# Under each question is a test to see if you've correctly completed the task.
# Lastly, there will be things in here we didn't cover. 90% of programming is being able to google things or ask the
# right people. Good luck!
